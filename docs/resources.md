**THIS PAGE IS A WIP**

First, these resources are largely compiled from other resources pages. I compiled the ones that I specifically use/have used to be less large.

I may include many different links for one category. The best will be labeled with a âœ¨ and ones that I use will be bolded.

## Resources Pages

- **[TheMoeWay Resources Page](https://learnjapanese.moe/resources/)** (âœ¨) - Very comprehensive, I got a ton of resources from here

- **[Refold Resources Page](https://www.notion.so/Refold-Japanese-Content-Resources-WIP-9121097535e74f6ba501c93b1773e70c)** - Haven't used much, but looks alright

## Anki

### Anki Decks

- **[Refold JP1K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYa08rDrNvuPINXsod5PgOd9qNDkfUkY/view?usp=sharing)** (âœ¨) - 1,000 common words used in slice-of-life anime, best if starting with anime
- [Core 2K/6K](https://djtguide.neocities.org/anki) - 6,000 common words used across various sources, might not be ideal for starting with anime but can act as a good filler deck after the 1K. Very commonly recommended, and the one I recommend to most since it's also free.
- [TheMoeWay Tango N5 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMlJvSrKQOSaiN8sPLdNDvWP31EClxDO/view?usp=sharing) - N5 sentence card deck. Used to be recommended by TheMoeWay as a starter deck, but I have no experience with it.

### Anki Addons

- **[AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)** (âœ¨) - Required for almost every mining setup
- **[True Retention](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/613684242)**  - Neat statistics addon that shows your retention rather than your accuracy. Can be useful for gauging whether or not you need Anki changes
- **[Local Audio Server for Yomichan](https://github.com/themoeway/local-audio-yomichan)** - Makes it so that Yomichan takes audio from your computer instead of the internet. Provides more audio source option and is faster than downloading from online sources.

### Anki Note Types

- **[JP Mining Note](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/)** (âœ¨) - I love this note type so much. If you're mining, this is THE note type. I love you Aquafina ðŸ’ž
- [Aquafina's Alternatives Page](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/alternatives/#note-types) - Speaking of Aquafina, he also laid out pretty much every notable alternative here. Of these I would probably use Anime Cards.

## Dictionaries (Yomichan)

- **[JMdict](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan)** (âœ¨) - I use JMdict English Extra with Examples for English definitions. If you're going to use JMdict, use this or compile from the [actual source](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project), pretty much everything else is out-of-date. 
- **[shoui's dictionary collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tTdLppnqMfVC5otPlX_cs4ixlIgjv_lH)** (âœ¨) - I use the recommended monolingual and frequency dictionaries from here. 
- **[JPDB](https://jpdb.io/)** - Not a Yomichan dictionary, but an online one. It looks better than jisho and has more information. It also has a built-in SRS if you don't wanna mine. I personally use it for pasting whole sentences and having it parse it.

## Browser Extensions

- **[Yomichan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami) (âœ¨) -** An absolute MUST HAVE. A pop-up dictionary that lets you do on-the-fly lookups on any text thatâ€™s highlightable. NOTE (02 June 2023): Yomichan is deprecated, but I think the most popular fork, [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan), still needs some more work. I will update this once it's in a better state.
- **[asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer)** (âœ¨) - What I used to use for mining and what I recommend for most people since the setup is quite simple. Lets you display highlightable subtitles on most streaming platforms and can also play local files. Supports automatic card creation/modification.
- **[Toggl Track](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-track-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn)** - If you use Toggl to track your time, saves a bit of time and an extra tab.
