Sorry, these aren't essays LOL but just random rants I think to myself but don't tell anyone so as to not bother them.

## Isn’t learning Japanese from anime bad because the Japanese in anime is unnatural?

There is some truth to this statement, but I think the discourse around it is largely inflated by people who are monolingual or have never learned a language themselves. Is there **some** unnaturality in the Japanese used in anime? Yes. If you only watch anime will your Japanese sound anime-y? Probably. Is it therefore bad to learn Japanese from anime? NO! Why? Because not **ALL** of it is unnatural. Think about what “natural” language even means. In my opinion, the language in its “natural” form is native speakers speaking completely unscripted. This excludes anime, manga, movies, drama, television shows, and 99% of entertainment because it’s scripted and therefore not the language in its truest, most “natural” form. But it doesn’t **matter.** Unless you are currently living in Japan, you aren’t going to be easily coming across the natural language. Also consider that even if it is supposedly less natural, what does that change? Do the words you learn suddenly mean nothing? Do the grammar points and sentence structures you hear in anime not line up with unscripted Japanese at all. The answer to all is NO. To illustrate my point, here is an excerpt from an American cartoon.

    “Careful there! You don’t wanna break your other foot too.”

    “No, I certainly don’t.”

    ”Don’t worry bro, once we repave this basketball court there won’t
     be a crack in sight.”

    “Thanks a lot guys. Since you’re all working so hard out here, I wanted
     to treat you to sandwiches from Sandwiccis.”

As a native English speaker I know you understand this. Look at the words used, they’re all really common English words right? Look at the grammar, is there any part of this that stands out to you as incorrect or unnatural English? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO IF ANYONE BOTHERS YOU FOR LEARNING JAPANESE THROUGH ANIME YOU CAN TELL THEM TO [redacted].

Obviously what I said doesn't necessarily prove anything. But those are just my two cents. I think the worry and concern is largely inflated and that anime won't permanently corrupt your Japanese.

## Should you only mine 1T sentences? 

If you don't know what a 1T sentence is, it's basically a sentence that you are really close to understanding, but you're missing one concept that is preventing you from understanding it. Once you understand that one concept, the sentence then makes sense to you. Refold recommends that you only mine these sentences. The idea is that since they're easily within reach, they will be much easier to rep in Anki. Now what do I think? I think there is some validity to this statement. Anecdotally, I do feel like 1T sentences are less likely for me to leech. I think it makes sense to mine only 1T, but I also don't think you should restrict yourself from mining only 1T if you don't want to. I really honestly believe that this specifically is just something you need to do for yourself before passing judgment. Throughout the different phases of my learning, I've gone back and forth between mining only 1T and mining everything. Right now, I'm back on the mining everything phase, though I still try to keep mined cards within reach. My feelings towards mining this way have changed every time I switched. When I used to rep sentence cards instead of vocab cards, any non-1T sentence was out of the question. When I switched to vocab cards, but was still pretty limited in vocab, non-1T cards were hard for me to remember. Nowadays, I don't really have issues with them. I'm not sure why. There are a ton of factors. I've been learning the language for longer now, I started sorting my new cards by frequency, I've built up a stronger familiarity with more kanji; I really believe you should just try mining non-1T and switching back if it's not working. Anki is a supplement.

## Regarding "tolerating ambiguity"

I will expand more later, but basically **tolerating ambiguity ≠ not paying attention**. The language won't just seep into your brain from pure exposure and no thought, at least not a rate you'd be happy with.
