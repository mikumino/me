For all of these recommendation pages, I'm only putting stuff that I have personally seen/read. Please don't yell at me for not including something because chances are I just haven't gotten to it yet :)

## Easy

### Summer Pockets

I'm a few hours in, so I can't say too much, but the intro at least is pretty easy. This might move positions later.

## Medium

### 君と彼女と彼女の恋

Relatively easy vocab, but some parts of this make it hard for me to put into the easy section. Notably, the game has some audio-only parts. They're simple enough that they shouldn't be a problem, but it's notable. It also have some language you wouldn't know if you haven't already read or are familiar with visual novels. I really like it though, but don't look anything up about it before playing.

### Tenshi☆Souzou RE-BOOT!

Also pretty easy but has some really heavy exposition moments. Without those, I would put this into easy, because the language in the game is quite simple.

## Difficult

### Nothing yet.
