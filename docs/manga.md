For all of these recommendation pages, I'm only putting stuff that I have personally seen/read. Please don't yell at me for not including something because chances are I just haven't gotten to it yet :)

### Bocchi the Rock!

Honestly was debating between putting this here or in difficult. I put it in Medium because I would say most of the scenes are not too difficult. HOWEVER, the manga makes a LOT of references to Japanese online culture and slang which can make some scenes harder. This is a particular issue if you're not really well-versed in the online culture since unless it's an older reference Yomichan will not pick up on it.
